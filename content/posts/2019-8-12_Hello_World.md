<code>print("Hello World!")</code>

The variants of this line of code is probably what you wrote when you first learned to program. Heck, I even wrote this 3 times (Hack, Android, IOS) in the past week during Facebook's Bootcamp, the companies ramp-up program for all new employees.

Speaking of Facebook, I began my first real job 2 weeks ago, and I meant to write this post to coincide with my first day of work and the start to my "adult" life. However, due to various reasons ( _aka fervently playing Fire Emblem: Three Houses_ ), I only managed to scrap together this website and post today.

"Hello World" seems fitting for marking my first day of work since what I do from now on will have a real impact on the world ( _hopefully I don't take down Facebook, even though it would have the realest of impact_ ). I recently came upon a non-profit called <a href="https://80000hours.org/about/">80000 Hours</a>. The purpose of the non-profit is to help individuals to find career paths that have the greatest impact in society. After all, we have approximately 80,000 hours in our careers, spending some time to maximize the impact of your long career seems to be worthwhile in the long run.

This topic hits home, as I am currently in a quarter-life crisis ( _I am also surprised this is a thing_ ). Specifically, I am lost as to what I want out of my life/career and how to feel fulfilled. I am in the fortunate position where I can pursue many different paths, and even for paths I can't immediately pursue, I have confidence that if I want to, I will eventually be able to pursue that path. The plethora of choices creates the choice overload problem, where I can't decide which career path is the best choice I can select. Obviously, if I don't care too much, I can just select a good choice and be happy about it. However, I still wonder if I would be content with that choice even if I knew there was a better option available.

In theory, this was supposed to be a light-hearted first post, but meh, whatever. I am also not feeling the mood to expand on the previous paragraph more right now, so I will just list why I am starting a blog.

There are several purposes:

* Writings blogs as a means of self-expression
* Forcing me to structuralize my thought process on various topics
* Providing motivation to work on various projects and hobbies

I may or may not write more on this post. I wonder if I should also keep track of edits on my posts.

I also added something I wrote two years ago but never published, it is extremely random lol.
