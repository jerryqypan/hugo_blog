_I put this in a private Github repo two years ago, but never published it because for some reason Github did not display markdown properly and I couldn't bold text by using ** **._

I was playing Maplestory several weeks ago (right before finals oops) and I came across a stat boosting feature called inner ability. Without getting into too much details, inner ability gives a character additional benefits which are randomly generated depending on the rarity of the inner ability.

There are four different rarities for a character's inner ability: rare, epic, unique, and legendary. A character's inner ability can be reset, which randomly changes the benefits it gives for 100 honor points, a collectible currency in the game. When a character's inner ability is reset, there is a chance for the rarity of the inner ability to increase or decrease. Here is a table of the approximate chances of increasing and decreasing the rarity of a character's inner ability:
<br>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th  style="text-align:center">Status</th>
    <th  style="text-align:center">Rare</th>
    <th  style="text-align:center">Epic</th>
    <th  style="text-align:center">Unique</th>
    <th  style="text-align:center">Legendary</th>
  </tr>
  <tr  style="text-align:center">
    <td>Increase Rank</td>
    <td>5%</td>
    <td>3%</td>
    <td>1%~2%</td>
    <td>0%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr  style="text-align:center">
    <td>Same Rank</td>
    <td>95%</td>
    <td>94%</td>
    <td>83%-84%</td>
    <td>50%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr  style="text-align:center">
    <td>Decrease Rank</td>
    <td>0%</td>
    <td>3%</td>
    <td>15%</td>
    <td>50%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The best benefits from inner ability comes from the legendary rarity, which leads the question: **how many resets of a character's inner ability does it take on average to get to legendary rarity from the other three rarities?**

It turns out, the process of resetting inner ability can be modeled as a discrete-time Markov Chain.

## Markov Chains

### Introduction

A Markov chain is a stochastic process that statisfies the Markov Property using states and transition probabilities between states. Here we are only going to consider finite state, discrete-time Markov chains. Usually, a Markov chain is denoted by the transition matrix p, where p(i,j) represents the transition probability from state i to state j. The Markov property is defined on the transition matrix p as:

<blockquote> Let X<sub>n</sub> be current state of the Markov chain and j, i, i<sub>n-1</sub>, ..., i<sub>0</sub> are states in the Markov chain, then: <br> <center>P(X<sub>n+1</sub> = j | X<sub>n</sub> = i, X<sub>n-1</sub> = i<sub>n-1</sub>, ... , X<sub>0</sub> = i<sub>0</sub>) = p(i, j)  </center><div style="text-align:right;margin-top:-20px">[1]</div></blockquote>

In layman's terms, the transition probabilities of the current state to the next states are independent of the previous states that has been visited.

As for resetting inner ability as a Markov Chain, the following is the transition matrix (using the pessimistic estimate for the probability of increasing rank from unique to legendary):

<div>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th  style="text-align:center">from \ to</th>
    <th  style="text-align:center">Rare</th>
    <th  style="text-align:center">Epic</th>
    <th  style="text-align:center">Unique</th>
    <th  style="text-align:center">Legendary</th>
  </tr>
  <tr  style="text-align:center">
  <th  style="text-align:center">Rare</th>
    <td>95%</td>
    <td>5%</td>
    <td>0%</td>
    <td>0%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr  style="text-align:center">
  <th  style="text-align:center">Epic</th>
    <td>3%</td>
    <td>94%</td>
    <td>3%</td>
    <td>0%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr  style="text-align:center">
  <th  style="text-align:center">Unique</th>
    <td>0%</td>
    <td>15%</td>
    <td>84%</td>
    <td>1%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr  style="text-align:center">
  <th  style="text-align:center">Legendary</th>
    <td>0%</td>
    <td>0%</td>
    <td>50%</td>
    <td>50%</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

An example of how to read this transition matrix is that there is a 5% chance to jump from rare to epic. Next lets talk about the stationary distribution for a Markov chain, which is a concept that leads to solving our question.

*Note: This transition matrix represents a special case of the Markov Chain known as a birth and death chain which makes solving our question even easier, but lets not think about it for now.*

### Stationary Distribution

A stationary distribution is basically the fraction of time the Markov chain is in each state. A stationary distribution &pi; must satisfy the following property:

<blockquote style="text-align:center">
&pi; = &pi;p <div style="text-align:right;margin-top:-20px">[2]</div>
</blockquote>

To calculate &pi;, you need to solve the system of equations that results from expanding the elements in [2]. In our case lets denote &pi;<sub>1</sub>, &pi;<sub>2</sub>, &pi;<sub>3</sub>, &pi;<sub>4</sub> to be the fraction of time of the process being in rare, epic, unique, legendary inner ability rarity. The four equations follow:

<blockquote>
<center> .95&pi;<sub>1</sub> + .03 &pi;<sub>2</sub> = &pi;<sub>1</sub></center>
<center> .05&pi;<sub>1</sub> + .94 &pi;<sub>2</sub> + .15 &pi;<sub>3</sub> = &pi;<sub>2</sub></center>
<center> .03&pi;<sub>2</sub> + .84 &pi;<sub>3</sub> + .5 &pi;<sub>4</sub> = &pi;<sub>3</sub></center>
<center> .01&pi;<sub>3</sub> + .5 &pi;<sub>4</sub> = &pi;<sub>4</sub></center>
</blockquote>

Before solving this system of equations there is just one problem, the rank of this matrix is 3. If the 4 equations are added up, the result would be:

<blockquote>
<center> &pi;<sub>1</sub> + &pi;<sub>2</sub> + &pi;<sub>3</sub> + &pi;<sub>4</sub> =  &pi;<sub>1</sub> + &pi;<sub>2</sub> + &pi;<sub>3</sub> + &pi;<sub>4</sub</center>
</blockquote>

Thus there are only 3 linearly independent rows of the matrix. The reason for this is because if you know the transition probability of getting to all but one state, you can figure out the probability of getting to that state by using the other transition probabiliies. Luckily, since &pi; is a probability distribution, we can replace the last equation with:

<blockquote>
<center> &pi;<sub>1</sub> + &pi;<sub>2</sub> + &pi;<sub>3</sub> + &pi;<sub>4</sub> =  1
</blockquote>

Solving the system of linearly equations using any method the result is:

<blockquote>
<center> &pi;<sub>1</sub> = .3326 </center>
<center> &pi;<sub>2</sub> = .5543 </center>
<center>&pi;<sub>3</sub> = .1109 </center>
<center>  &pi;<sub>4</sub> = .0022 </center>
</blockquote>

If you reset your character's inner ability an infinite number of times, only 0.0022 of the time, would your character have a legendary rarity inner ability. However, this does not solve how many resets it takes to get to legendary rarity.

### Exit Times

Lets assume that you will stop resetting your inner ability once your inner ability's rarity is legendary. Let g(x) denote the expected time for you to reach legendary inner ability from state x.  g(4) = 0 since you have already reached legendary inner ability. We can model g(x) for the other states as:

<blockquote>
<center> g(1) = 1 + .95g(1) + .05g(2)</center>
<center> g(2) = 1 + .03g(1) + .94g(2) + .03g(3)</center>
<center> g(3) = 1 + .15g(2) + .84g(3)</center>
</blockquote>

Adding 1 keeps track of the number of steps that has been taken. Solving this system of equations result in:

<blockquote>
<center> g(1) = 973.33</center>
<center> g(2) = 953.33</center>
<center> g(3) = 900</center>
</blockquote>

If you start resetting from rare, epic, unique rarity, it takes ~973, ~953, 900 resets to get to legendary rarity!

## Conclusion

Part of the reason why I did this was because I had ~1,000,000 honor points and I wanted to get my character's inner ability to legendary rarity, but after 10000 resets, I was still not able to reach legendary rarity so I wanted to find out how many resets it would takes on average. After doing the calculations, I was pretty sad that I was so unlucky.

Even though I was bummed about my luck, I felt pretty good using knowledge I gained from a class I took this semester. I would like to acknowledge that I took the definition in [1] from *Essentials of Stochastic Processes*, which is written by Rick Durrett, the professor of the Applied Stochastic Processes class I took.

Let me know if there were any mistakes or if you have any thoughts about this.
